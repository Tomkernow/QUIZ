  title: "Case Studies",
  questions: [

    {
      question: "CASE 1: You purchase 30kt crude oil FOB West Africa and sell it CIF Mediterranean. At what point does title and risk transfer?",
      choices: [
        "When vessel crosses load port breakwater",
        "At ship‚Äôs rail during loading (FOB)",
        "Upon discharge at discharge port terminal",
        "When buyer receives Bill of Lading"
      ],
      correct: [1],
      explanation: "Under FOB, risk transfers at ship‚Äôs rail in the load port. For CIF, seller arranges freight and insurance but risk transfers earlier at loading."
    },
    {
  question: "CASE 2: You sell 25kt ULSD DAP Rotterdam. Receiver changes discharge port to Hamburg at short notice. What are your exposures?",
  choices: [
    "Seller bears diversion cost unless contract allows pass-through",
    "Buyer automatically pays extra freight",
    "Operational risk of missed laycan or storage",
    "No exposure since DAP covers only Rotterdam"
  ],
  correct: [0,2],
  explanation: "Under DAP, seller must deliver at nominated port. If buyer requests diversion, cost typically falls to seller unless contract has diversion clauses. Extra logistics and timing risks arise."
},
    {
      question: "CASE 3: A vessel carrying 45kt jet fuel under CFR Singapore is delayed 6 days awaiting berth. Who pays demurrage?",
      choices: [
        "Always the seller, since CFR",
        "Buyer, since risk passes once cargo is loaded",
        "Depends on charterparty terms linked to sales contract",
        "Demurrage not applicable on CFR trades"
      ],
      correct: [2],
      explanation: "CFR trades include freight, but demurrage depends on contract linkage. Unless clearly passed to buyer, seller may still carry exposure."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 4: You fix a vessel to load 60kt crude from Basrah under FOB terms. Loading terminal requests crude oil washing (COW). Why is this important?",
      choices: [
        "Reduces cargo contamination risk",
        "Maximizes outturn by cleaning tanks",
        "Improves safety and reduces sludge build-up",
        "Optional, with no impact on quantity"
      ],
      correct: [1,2],
      explanation: "COW ensures tanks are cleaned using cargo itself, reducing sludge and improving outturn at discharge."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 5: You receive a Bill of Lading for a crude cargo. What key elements must you verify?",
      choices: [
        "Shipper, consignee, notify party",
        "Quantity, grade, load port",
        "Freight cost breakdown",
        "Clean on Board statement"
      ],
      correct: [0,1,3],
      explanation: "Bills of Lading confirm title. Accuracy in parties, cargo details, and cleanliness are critical. Freight breakdown is not part of the BL."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 6: You have 40kt gasoline storage in ARA. Market flips to strong backwardation. Which strategy optimizes value?",
      choices: [
        "Sell cargo immediately to capture spot premium",
        "Roll storage and wait for forward rebound",
        "Swap forward paper to hedge carry loss",
        "Blend with heavier components to delay sales"
      ],
      correct: [0,2],
      explanation: "Backwardation punishes storage, so immediate sales + paper hedges are rational. Blending doesn‚Äôt address time-value loss."
    },
    {
  question: "CASE 7: Your crude cargo is shipped under CIF Fujairah. Insurance certificate is missing in documentation. What risk arises?",
  choices: [
    "No risk ‚Äì cargo already afloat",
    "Buyer can refuse payment under LC",
    "Seller risks non-payment due to missing docs",
    "Bank may reject documents for discrepancy"
  ],
  correct: [1,2,3],
  explanation: "CIF requires seller to provide invoice, B/L and insurance. Missing insurance certificate is a documentary discrepancy: buyer/bank may refuse payment, creating cash flow risk."
},
    {
      question: "CASE 8: A 25kt diesel cargo sold FOB USGC faces hurricane port closure. Who bears risk?",
      choices: [
        "Buyer, since FOB transfers risk at loading",
        "Seller, since cargo not yet shipped",
        "Depends on force majeure clause",
        "Joint exposure split between buyer and seller"
      ],
      correct: [1],
      explanation: "If cargo not yet loaded, seller still bears risk. Once ship‚Äôs rail is crossed, risk transfers."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 9: You charter a vessel at $20k/day to move crude. Cargo faces 5-day waiting time at load port due to congestion. Who pays?",
      choices: [
        "Charterer, under time charter",
        "Owner, under voyage charter",
        "Always shared 50/50",
        "Not defined, depends on CP terms"
      ],
      correct: [0],
      explanation: "Under time charter, charterer pays daily hire regardless of delay. Under voyage CP, owners bear port waiting unless laytime/demurrage triggers."
    },
   {
  question: "CASE 10: A ULSD cargo sold DAP Rotterdam arrives during a trucking strike. What is the likely outcome?",
  choices: [
    "The seller remains responsible until the product leaves the terminal by truck.",
    "The buyer bears the risk once the cargo is delivered to the agreed terminal, including delays from the trucking strike.",
    "Demurrage is always for the seller under DAP.",
    "The cargo ownership remains with the seller until trucks arrive."
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "Under DAP (Delivered at Place), the seller‚Äôs responsibility ends when the cargo arrives at the agreed place of delivery ‚Äî in this case, the Rotterdam terminal. A trucking strike delaying onward distribution does not shift responsibility back to the seller. The buyer bears costs and risks from this point, including storage or supply chain delays, unless the contract specifies otherwise (e.g., delivered into tanks)."
},
    {
      question: "CASE 11: A vessel on a voyage charter arrives at load port with dirty tanks. What is the consequence?",
      choices: [
        "Charterer can reject vessel",
        "Cargo contamination risk increases",
        "Loading may be delayed for cleaning",
        "No impact if tanks are visually acceptable"
      ],
      correct: [0,1,2],
      explanation: "Dirty tanks delay loading and can contaminate cargo. Charterer may reject until cleaned."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 12: You buy 20kt Jet A1 CIF. On arrival, cargo fails flash point specification. Who is responsible?",
      choices: [
        "Seller, since quality risk remains until discharge",
        "Buyer, since cargo already shipped",
        "Independent inspector at load port",
        "Depends on contract specification basis"
      ],
      correct: [0,3],
      explanation: "Seller is responsible for supplying spec cargo. Liability depends on inspection clause (load or discharge)."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 13: A crude cargo STS transfer results in ROB (remaining on board). Who absorbs losses?",
      choices: [
        "Always the buyer",
        "Always the seller",
        "Depends on contract and STS terms",
        "Split evenly between both parties"
      ],
      correct: [2],
      explanation: "Loss allocation for STS depends on agreed terms. Standard is ship‚Äôs rail or hose connection."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 14: You hedge a physical gasoline cargo with futures. Market spikes up after sale. What happens?",
      choices: [
        "Hedge offsets physical loss of opportunity",
        "You miss upside gains on physical cargo",
        "Futures loss matches physical missed profit",
        "You are fully risk-free"
      ],
      correct: [0,1,2],
      explanation: "Hedging locks price and prevents upside participation. Futures losses offset missed gains."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 15: A VLCC chartered for crude has draft restriction at discharge port. What risk arises?",
      choices: [
        "Partial discharge via ship-to-ship (lightering)",
        "Higher discharge costs",
        "Port refusal and deviation",
        "No impact, VLCCs always accepted"
      ],
      correct: [0,1,2],
      explanation: "Shallow ports require lightering. This adds costs and delays. Sometimes deviation is needed."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 16: You buy 30kt diesel FOB and seller delays loading 7 days. What claim can you make?",
      choices: [
        "Demurrage under charterparty",
        "Delay claim under sales contract",
        "Force majeure automatically excuses seller",
        "No recourse, delays are normal"
      ],
      correct: [0,1],
      explanation: "Buyer can claim demurrage if vessel is waiting, and damages under sales contract unless force majeure applies."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 17: An oil terminal requires MSDS documents before loading. Why?",
      choices: [
        "To comply with safety regulations",
        "To identify hazards of the cargo",
        "To calculate freight cost",
        "To ensure proper handling and storage"
      ],
      correct: [0,1,3],
      explanation: "MSDS ensures health, safety, and environmental compliance. It doesn‚Äôt affect freight cost."
    },
    {
      question: "CASE 18: A crude oil cargo loses 0.3% on outturn vs Bill of Lading. What is this called?",
      choices: [
        "Demurrage",
        "Freight adjustment",
        "Shortage/Outturn loss",
        "Freight tax"
      ],
      correct: [2],
      explanation: "Loss between BL and discharge is outturn loss or shortage. Contracts often allow small tolerances."
    },
    {
  question: "CASE 19: You sell gasoline CFR West Africa. Freight rates spike after fixing. Who bears cost?",
  choices: [
    "Seller ‚Äì CFR includes freight, so higher rates matter if not yet fixed",
    "Buyer ‚Äì since they receive landed cargo",
    "No one ‚Äì once vessel is fixed, seller is protected",
    "Shared automatically"
  ],
  correct: [0,2],
  explanation: "Under CFR, seller pays freight. If rates spike before vessel fixing, seller is exposed. Once freight is fixed, seller is protected ‚Äì buyer always pays agreed CFR price."
},
    {
      question: "CASE 20: A ship‚Äôs ETA is delayed 4 days. Notice of Readiness (NOR) was tendered early. Is it valid?",
      choices: [
        "Yes, always valid",
        "No, NOR invalid if vessel not ready",
        "Valid only if berth is free",
        "Depends on charterparty clauses"
      ],
      correct: [1,3],
      explanation: "NOR must be valid (vessel ready in all respects). CP terms may alter requirements."
    },

{
  question: "CASE 21: You fix a vessel DAP Rotterdam. Receiver requests diversion to Hamburg (extra $2/mt). Who pays the cost?",
  choices: [
    "Seller ‚Äì DAP means delivery at agreed port",
    "Buyer ‚Äì diversion is their request",
    "Shared, depending on contract wording",
    "Port authority"
  ],
  correct: [0,2],
  explanation: "DAP binds seller to deliver at nominated port. Diversion costs depend on whether contract allows buyer-requested diversions."
},
{
  question: "CASE 22: A crude tanker must pass through Suez Canal. Suez Canal Dues = $400k. Cargo 1,000,000 bbl. What is cost per barrel?",
  choices: [
    "$0.40/bbl",
    "$0.20/bbl",
    "$0.80/bbl",
    "$0.04/bbl"
  ],
  correct: [0],
  explanation: "$400k √∑ 1,000,000 bbl = $0.40/bbl canal cost."
},
{
  question: "CASE 23: You sell gasoline FOB. Vessel arrives with dirty tanks, delaying loading 3 days. Who bears delay costs?",
  choices: [
    "Buyer ‚Äì vessel is on their account",
    "Seller ‚Äì since they own the cargo",
    "Shared equally",
    "Operator covers it"
  ],
  correct: [0],
  explanation: "FOB ‚Üí buyer nominates and pays for vessel. Delay due to vessel condition = buyer‚Äôs risk."
},
{
  question: "CASE 24: A ULSD parcel off-spec on sulphur (10 ppm limit). Retesting shows 13 ppm. Options?",
  choices: [
    "Downgrade to higher sulphur pool (off-road diesel)",
    "Blend with lower sulphur to on-spec",
    "Reject cargo completely",
    "Sell into marine gasoil market"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,3],

},
{
  question: "CASE 25: You sell crude CIF China. Vessel faces weather delay 5 days at discharge. Who pays demurrage?",
  choices: [
    "Seller",
    "Buyer",
    "Shared",
    "Depends on contract"
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "CIF transfers risk after loading. Buyer pays discharge demurrage unless otherwise specified."
},
{
  question: "CASE 26: A refinery runs 200 kbpd. Switching from Brent to WTI saves $0.50/bbl. Monthly savings?",
  choices: [
    "$1.5m",
    "$2m",
    "$3m",
    "$4m"
  ],
  correct: [2],
  explanation: "200k √ó 30 √ó $0.50 = $3m monthly saving."
},
{
  question: "CASE 27: A storage terminal allows commingling. Risks?",
  choices: [
    "Spec contamination",
    "Inventory reconciliation issues",
    "Lower operational flexibility",
    "Blending gains/losses"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,3],
  explanation: "Commingling risks specs & reconciliation, but can generate blending opportunities."
},
{
  question: "CASE 28: You trade LPG on CFR India. Buyer refuses discharge due to low temp spec. Actions?",
  choices: [
    "Negotiate discount",
    "Divert to alternate port",
    "Reject cargo",
    "Blend with warmer LPG"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,3],
  explanation: "Rejection leads to losses. Best is renegotiate, divert, or blend."
},
{
  question: "CASE 29: A 75kt naphtha cargo priced vs MOPJ cracks. During voyage, MOPJ drops $25/mt. Who bears risk?",
  choices: [
    "Buyer, since price was fixed at loading",
    "Seller, if sale was priced at delivery",
    "Depends on pricing clause (loading vs arrival)",
    "Shared automatically"
  ],
  correct: [1,2],
  explanation: "If sale is arrival-priced, seller exposed. If loading-priced, buyer risk."
},
{
  question: "CASE 30: You buy 50kt HSFO FOB. At delivery, IMO switch requires VLSFO. Options?",
  choices: [
    "Blend HSFO with low-sulphur cutter stock to meet 0.5%",
    "Store HSFO until scrubber demand or resale market emerges",
    "Sell HSFO into alternative markets (e.g. power generation)",
    "Force seller to deliver VLSFO instead"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,2],
  explanation: "FOB means buyer takes risk once cargo loaded. IMO 2020 regulation change makes HSFO less valuable. Options are blending, storing until demand returns, or selling into alternate sectors. Seller has no obligation to replace HSFO with VLSFO."
},
{
  question: "CASE 31: You consider floating storage of 80kt ULSD for 4 months. Costs: freight $1.5m, storage $1.2m, finance $0.8m. Forward contango = $5/mt. Net P&L?",
  choices: [
    "Profit ‚âà +$200k",
    "Break-even",
    "Loss ‚âà ‚àí$3.1m",
    "Profit ‚âà +$1.5m"
  ],
  correct: [2],
  explanation: "Contango gain = 80,000 √ó $5 = $400k. Costs = $3.5m. Net = $400k ‚àí $3.5m = ‚àí$3.1m loss. Floating storage only works if contango exceeds total costs."
},
{
  question: "CASE 32: A 40kt gasoline cargo for USAC is delayed 10 days in ARA due to strike. Risks?",
  choices: [
    "Demurrage accrual on the vessel",
    "Loss of arbitrage if spread closes",
    "Buyer may cancel if laycan missed",
    "No impact ‚Äì strikes are force majeure"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,2],
  explanation: "Delays cause demurrage (~$150k‚Äì200k). In backwardation, waiting erodes value and arb economics may vanish. If laycan is missed, buyer may have right to cancel. Force majeure depends on contract wording ‚Äì not automatic protection."
},
{
  question: "CASE 33: Refinery feedstock choice ‚Äì Light sweet crude is $4/bbl more expensive than medium sour, but saves $2/bbl in desulfurization and yields +$1/bbl margin uplift. Net economics?",

    "Seller (cargo not ready)",
    "Shared equally",
    "Depends on charter party wording"
  ],
  correct: [0,3],
  explanation: "FOB ‚Üí vessel delays usually buyer‚Äôs risk. But CP force majeure/laytime clauses can alter responsibility."
},
{
  question: "CASE 35: You buy LPG CIF India. Freight spiked post-fixture +$40/mt. Who bears exposure?",
  choices: [
    "Buyer, always",
    "Seller, since CIF includes freight",

    "Depends on incoterms"
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "CIF seller pays freight. Buyer pays agreed landed cost regardless of freight spike."
},
{
  question: "CASE 36: A crude vessel draft exceeds port limit. Options?",
  choices: [
    "STS lightering offshore",
    "Switch to smaller ship",
    "Discharge partial and return",
    "Cancel cargo"
  ],
  correct: [0,1],
  explanation: "Most practical fixes: lighter offshore or re-fix smaller ship."
},
{
  question: "CASE 37: A 100kt HSFO parcel stored 6 months loses density and develops sediment. Risks?",
  choices: [
    "Quality downgrade to low-value pool",
    "Blending cost to recover spec",
    "Insurance claim rejection (storage-related)",

  correct: [0,1,2],
  explanation: "Storage deterioration hits value and may invalidate insurance cover. No positive uplift here."
},
{
  question: "CASE 38: You sell ULSD CFR Med. Vessel delayed 7 days at load port due to terminal strike. Who pays?",
  choices: [
    "Seller, since vessel fixed on their account",
    "Buyer, since they take risk from shipment onward",
    "Shared equally",
    "Depends on contract"
  ],
  correct: [0],
  explanation: "CFR means seller arranges freight. Delays at load port fall on seller‚Äôs account."
},
{
  question: "CASE 39: Storage economics ‚Äì Rent $2.50/mt/month. You store 60kt for 90 days. Market contango pays $9/mt. Finance = $0.50/mt/month. Net?",
  choices: [
    "+$1/mt gain",
    "Break-even",
    "‚àí$2/mt loss",
    "+$2/mt gain"
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "Storage 2.5√ó3 = $7.5; finance 0.5√ó3 = $1.5; total = $9. Spread = $9 ‚Üí break-even."
},
{
  question: "CASE 40: Two arbs open: ARA‚ÜíWAF at +$10/mt net, ARA‚ÜíUSAC at +$12/mt net. USAC has higher congestion risk (7 days demurrage). Which is safer trade?",
  choices: [
    "USAC, since net is higher",
    "WAF, lower congestion risk",
    "Both equal after risk adjustment",
    "Neither"
  ],
  correct: [1,3],
  explanation: "Nominal net is higher to USAC, but congestion risk erodes margin. Adjusted, WAF may be safer."
},
{
  question: "CASE 41: You buy crude FOB MEG and sell CIF Med. The ship breaks down after passing Suez. Who bears the cost?",
  choices: [
    "Buyer, since cargo is on their account after FOB",
    "Seller, since CIF sale requires delivery",
    "Shared equally",
    "Depends on insurance coverage"
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "FOB purchase ‚Üí buyer takes risk once loaded. But CIF sale ‚Üí seller is responsible to deliver cargo to buyer‚Äôs port, so the breakdown cost falls on seller."
},
{
  question: "CASE 42: A refinery has a chance to switch 50kt crude from heavy sour to medium sweet at +$3/bbl premium. Hydrotreater is constrained. Which is better?",
  choices: [
    "Stick with heavy sour, cheaper",
    "Switch to medium sweet, lower downstream sulfur cost",
    "Both equal",
    "Need to compare desulfurization margin"
  ],
  correct: [1],
  explanation: "With limited desulfurization, sour crude would cause off-spec products or higher cost. Sweet crude saves margin downstream despite higher crude cost."
},
{
  question: "CASE 43: You sell diesel DAP inland location. Buyer requests a change of discharge port at the last minute. What are the likely impacts?",
  choices: [
    "The seller must comply without additional cost.",
    "The buyer is responsible for any extra transport, storage, or delay costs linked to the change.",
    "DAP requires the seller to cover all risks until final delivery, even if the buyer changes destination.",
    "If the seller accepts the change, it should be subject to renegotiation of terms and possible compensation."
  ],
  correct: [1, 3],
  explanation: "Under DAP, the seller delivers to the agreed location, bearing transport and risk until that point. If the buyer unilaterally changes the discharge port, the seller has no obligation to comply without renegotiation. If the seller agrees, the buyer should assume additional costs (freight, delays, storage). The key is that the delivery point in the contract defines the seller‚Äôs responsibility ‚Äî any last-minute change creates exposure unless contractually amended."
},
{
  question: "CASE 44: Brent is flat, ULSD crack widens +$8/bbl. Strategy?",
  choices: [
    "Maximize diesel runs",
    "Hedge cracks via paper",
    "Ignore as irrelevant",
    "Shift barrels from jet to diesel"
  ],
  correct: [0,1,3],
  explanation: "Higher crack = higher diesel margin. Optimize yields and hedge exposure to capture uplift."

    "‚àí$6/mt monthly loss",
    "‚àí$2/mt monthly loss",
    "Break-even"
  ],
  correct: [0],
  explanation: "Backwardation erodes value by $6/mt per month. Storage adds $2/mt. Total loss = $8/mt √ó 100,000 = ‚àí$800k per month."
},
{
  question: "CASE 46: You buy crude DES Europe. Vessel delayed 12 days by storm. Who pays demurrage?",
  choices: [
    "Seller, as they deliver to Europe",

  choices: [
    "Paper gain (cheap freight locked in)",
    "No effect on current trade",
    "Potential to sublet at profit",
    "Loss"
  ],
  correct: [0,2],
  explanation: "Fixing early locks cheap freight. You can capture arbitrage margin or re-let vessel at a premium."

    "Replace vessel with a compliant ship",
    "Force terminal to load despite vetting failure",
    "Delay until vetting passes",
    "Cancel contract or renegotiate terms"
  ],
  correct: [0,3],
  explanation: "FOB = buyer nominates vessel. If the ship fails vetting, it cannot load. Options are to replace vessel or renegotiate the contract. Forcing the terminal is impossible; delaying may breach laycan."
